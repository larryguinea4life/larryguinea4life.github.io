We are basically educational consultants providing guidance and academic support for students at the 
tertiary level in fostering better understanding of their courseworks and giving advisory 
and support services in completing coursework assignments, projects, Theses and Dissertations as may be required. 
We do not engage in providing 'turn key' intervention(s). Instead, we only provide assistance in aid of intelligible and acceptable outcomes. 
This is what we do in respect of all educational support services that may be required at the tertiary (undergraduate and postgraduate)levels.
